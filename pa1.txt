MP1: Vector Addition (Resubmit)
Due: Mon, Jan 14, 2013 23:59 PST

If you did not do well on this MP, then we will allow you to resubmit and recieve up to 80% of the score.

A detail of you grade is found here.

Objective

The purpose of this lab is to get you familiar with using the CUDA API by implementing a simple vector addition kernel and its associated setup code.

Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, make sure that:

You can have completed lecture 2 video

You have completed MP 0

You have looked over the help document.

Chapter 3 of the text book would also be helpful

Instruction

Edit the code in the code tab to perform the following:

Allocate device memory

Copy host memory to device

Initialize thread block and kernel grid dimensions

Invoke CUDA kernel

Copy results from device to host

Free device memory

Write the CUDA kernel

Instructions about where to place each part of the code is demarcated by the //@@ comment lines.

Suggestions

Develop your application incrementally

Do not modify the template code written -- only insert code where the //@@ demarcation is placed

Make sure to test your results against all the datasets provided

Do not wait until the last minute to attempt the lab.

Make sure that you test your program using all the datasets provided (the datasets can be selected using the dropdown next to the submission button)

Even though you can submit multiple times, only your last submission is graded.
